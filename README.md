# Stock Wish List

The Stock Wish List is a project that allows the user to keep track of the stocks that they are looking to buy. It aims to let the user enter in the details of the company they want to invest in and let them enter in the due-diligence that they have done on the company. Finally, the user can remove a stock from their wish list if they end up buying the stock or decide that they no longer want to invest in it.
